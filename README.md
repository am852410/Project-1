LOTERIA!!

[Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/zBu66q)



As a user, I should be able to start a LOTERIA game.


As a user, I should be able to click a button that draws a random 3x3 game card.


When the game begins, I should be given 9 coins to add to my game card.


When the game begins, I should see a random card introduced every 4 seconds. 


As a user, I should win the game once the entire game card is filled with the correct random card introduced.


As a user, I should be shown a message when I win the game.
